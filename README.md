# Innovate-HS-Design

Hey All! This is the Git Repo for the Design/Front-End-Dev for the Spring 2020 Innovate HS project! *Throws Confettii* 

Here's some material for how to branch and merge Repos since there will be a lot of us on this repo:

I recommend using Github Desktop for easy access to the Repo on your computer :)
Also if you are having any issues, or need help with Github or Repo branching, feel free to message me or call (I'll do my IT Helpdesk Voice).

Good luck!
