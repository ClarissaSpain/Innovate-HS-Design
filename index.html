    <p>Dear Juniors:</p>

    <p>We are excited to welcome you to spend the day at UM on Tuesday, April
    7th! We are designing this conference just for you. Mansfield Center:
    InnovateHS is all about Imagination and Problem Solving. You will be
    challenged throughout the day to explore how creativity, collaboration,
    and analysis can be used to develop novel solutions to complex problems.
    </p>

    <p>The day includes active learning, peer engagement, and small group
    presentations by UM faculty, as well as lunch at the Food Zoo. We encourage
    you to be active participants throughout the day as you consider how
    innovation applies to your lives and to the issues that most concern you.
    </p>
