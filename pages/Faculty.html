      adventures. We will meet in a multi-purpose archaeology laboratory that
      serves as a working classroom, "dirty" lab, and haven for student research
      that contributes to the greater good. Visiting MCPS students will receive
      behind-the-scenes updates on recent projects that demonstrate how
      archaeological and linguistic evidence can help democratize our community's
      complex history by triggering recollections of the nearly lost heritage
      of Missoula's past residents. Students interested in this session are
      encouraged to consider the "7 Skulls - 7 Stories: Teasers in Forensic

      Together we will practice creating a budget and look ahead to financial aid
      opportunities that can help pay for college. Financial stress is one source of
      stress that students may find themselves experiencing as they transition into
      college. A 2012 study examined the top stressors college students face, and
      found that four of the top five stressors were all related to finances. In this
      session students will begin brainstorming their path to financial fitness. </p>
